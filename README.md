## Architecture

This project intend to use the concept of microservices design
Especially [UserAuth Service](https://github.com/ivrylobs/user-auth) module has responsiblity for user registeration and user authentication which stand before each of other services
There 2 others microservices checkout here
[Appointment Service](https://github.com/ivrylobs/appointments) and [Real-time Session Microservice]() <br>
In authentication layer every request should be valid before pass through gateway to other services if the request that attached Jwt inside header is invalid client should refresh the token by refresh token that receive since login or re-login again
